## 📘 Topics Covered

### 🔹 OOP Concepts
- ✅ **Abstraction**: Using abstract classes and/or interfaces
- ✅ **Encapsulation**: Using private fields and public getters/setters
- ✅ **Inheritance**: Demonstrating base and derived classes
- ✅ **Polymorphism**: Method overloading and overriding

### 🔹 Utility & Practice Programs (in `Programes.java`)
- Coin toss simulation
- Leap year check
- Finding factors of a number
- Quotient and remainder
- Swapping numbers
- Even or odd check
- Vowel or consonant check
- Finding the largest among three numbers
- Printing squares (power of 2)
- Harmonic number series

### 🔹 Input Handling
- Getting user input using `Scanner` class (`user_input.java`)

## ▶️ How to Run the Programs

1. **Clone the repo**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/java-Oops.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the source folder**:
   ```bash
   cd java-Oops/java_new/src
   ```

3. **Compile and run a Java file**:
   ```bash
   javac com/java/Programs.java
   java com.java.Programs
   ```

> Make sure your terminal is in the `src` directory so the package paths resolve correctly.

## 🧠 Ideal For

- Java beginners learning OOP
