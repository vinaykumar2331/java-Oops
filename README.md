# Java OOPs and Basic Programs 🚀

This repository contains Java programs that demonstrate core **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts along with a collection of **basic utility programs** for beginners. It is designed to provide hands-on examples for learning and revising Java fundamentals.

## 📘 Topics Covered

### 🔹 OOP Concepts
- ✅ **Abstraction**: Using abstract classes and/or interfaces
- ✅ **Encapsulation**: Using private fields and public getters/setters
- ✅ **Inheritance**: Demonstrating base and derived classes
- ✅ **Polymorphism**: Method overloading and overriding

### 🔹 Utility & Practice Programs (in `Programes.java`)
- Coin toss simulation
- Leap year check
- Finding factors of a number
- Quotient and remainder
- Swapping numbers
- Even or odd check
- Vowel or consonant check
- Finding the largest among three numbers
- Printing squares (power of 2)
- Harmonic number series

### 🔹 Input Handling (in `user_input.java`)
The `user_input.java` file demonstrates usage of the `Scanner` class to take various types of user input and perform basic operations like:

- Name confirmation loop
- Sum and product of integers
- Rectangle area calculation
- Printing user profile (name, roll number, interest)
- Square of a number
- Concatenating strings
- Perimeter of a square
- Equality check among three numbers
- Condition checking using `if-else`
- Marks input with validation (max 100 per subject)
- Percentage calculation


## ▶️ How to Run the Programs

1. **Clone the repo**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/java-Oops.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the source folder**:
   ```bash
   cd java-Oops/java_new/src
   ```

3. **Compile and run a Java file**:
   ```bash
   javac com/java/Programs.java
   java com.java.Programs
   ```

> Make sure your terminal is in the `src` directory so the package paths resolve correctly.

## 🧠 Ideal For

- Java beginners learning OOP
- Students practicing for exams or interviews
- Quick revision of Java fundamentals through examples
